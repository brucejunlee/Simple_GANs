# Simple_GANs



In this project, we review the history and some characteristics of the generative adversarial networks (GANs) until 2019. 

Then, we give simple implementations of some famous GAN architectures, such as vanilla GAN, conditional GAN, energy-based GAN, boundary&equilibrium GAN, coupled GAN, adversarial learned inference, f-GAN, InfoGAN, least-square GAN, Wasserstein GAN, and WGAN-gradient penalty. 

Here, we just use simple MLPs as the standard network blocks.

The GAN model with deep convolutional networks (e.g., DCGAN, now it is often regarded as the standard GAN model) is also implemented.

GANs using optimal transport will be studied very soon.

Some other GAN models, for example, CycleGAN, Progressive growing GAN, StyleGAN, pix2pix, Superresolution GAN, self-attention GAN, Triple GAN, BigGAN, etc. may be considered in future works.
